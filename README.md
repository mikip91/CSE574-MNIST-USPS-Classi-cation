# CSE574-MNIST-USPS-Classification
In this experiment, We studied how to apply machine learning to solve the classiﬁcation task. 
Our objective was to recognize a 28 * 28 grayscale handwritten digit image and identify it as a digit among 0, 1, 2, ... , 9. 
Classiﬁers such as Multiclass Logistic Regression, Neural Networks, Support Vector Machine and Random Forest are used for our purpose.
The feature vectors are obtained from MNIST dataset and testing is done on both MNIST and USPS dataset. 
Experiments on various hyper-parameters were performed for their eect on the accuracy of the program. 
The results of various classiﬁers were observed using Confusion Matrices. 
Majority Voting ensembling method is carried out for all the four classiﬁers. 
The best accuracy was achieved using convolutional neural networks and majority voting ensembler.
